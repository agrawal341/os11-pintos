			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In page.h:

struct sup_page
{
	struct hash_elem elem; 		/* the hash element */

	void* vaddr;				/* kernel address if swap, id if disk */

	bool swap;					/* 1 => swap, 0 => disk */

	bool isExec;				/* 1 => exec file of the current process  */
	struct Elf32_Ehdr *ehdr;	/* ELF header */

	struct file * f;			/* file / page link */
	uint32_t offset; 			/* internal file offset */
	uint32_t length; 			/* size of the file contents */
};

This is the supplemental page table, which supplements the page table with 
additional data about each page.

In frame.h:

struct hash user_frames;
struct lock user_frames_lock;

struct frame
  {
    struct hash_elem hash_elem; /* Hash table element. */

    uint32_t id;		/* Frame / Swap table id. */
    uint32_t *pagedir;	/* User page directory. */
    void* upage;		/* User Page. */
  };
  
The hashtable, lock and the struct for arranging the frame structure and to avoid
race conditions.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

When we need to lookup a frame for a virtual address, the function page_lookup in 
page.c is called, which takes the virtual address and searches for it in the supplemental 
page table since this has the hash key in it.
It returns the page which contains the physical address if any. Otherwise it returns NULL.



>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

The user programs are always using the virtual address to access pages.
Since we did not implement sharing of pages, only one process has access to a 
certain frame.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

We are using a lock that locks all critical sections when requesting a frame or any
access to the frame table.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

We decided to use a hash table since it is easy to find a certain page with its virtual 
address as identifier. Additionally, the structure allows for dynamic growing, which means
that we do not waste memory here.


		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Those can be found in Part A.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

We did not find the time to implement eviction.

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

We tried to use a minimal amount of locks to keep parallelism. For that, we
only keep one lock for frame and page table.
So data structures are only accessed by one process at a time and we were focusing
on the right order of acquiring the locks to prevent deadlocks.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?

This is ensured by keeping the frame lock while accessing critical sections.

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur

This is also ensured by keeping the frame lock.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Added to thread.h:

typedef int mapid_t;
#define MAP_FAILED ((mapid_t) -1)          /* Error value for mapid_t. */

struct mapping_elem
  {
    struct list_elem elem;				/* list dummy */
    mapid_t mapid;                        /* mapping identifier */
    void *addr;                         /* virtual address of mapping */
    int page_count;                  /* number of mapped pages */
    struct file *file;  /* reopened file for mapping purposes */
  };
  
  A mapping element is an element of 
  
    struct list mappings;               /* List of mapped files */
  
  which is the new data structure to handle memory mapped files. 

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

MMF get created through a call of mmap, where we install the mapping of the file and
lazily allocate a corresponding number of pages. A new element in the mappings list
is created, such that we can access the file even if it is closed by the user.
We do not differ in case of page fault between memory mapped and other pages.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

This is done by calling pagedir_get_page with the given address for each page that
we want to allocate. It returns NULL iff this page is not mapped yet.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of

We do not differ between those two situations.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
